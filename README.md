# bss-laravel-export
A simple laravel exporter for bootstrap studio

<ol>
  <li>Add laravel-bss.css to project</li>
  <li>Add a pages folder to your views</li>
  <li>Select the root directory of your laravel project</li>
  <li>Go to export->advanced and select the laravel.bat file</li>
  <li>For any blade code, add it in a Custom code block in <code></code> tags</li>
  <li>Export and have fun.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>You still have to set-up the controllers manually, I might automate that in the future
  <li>You still have to move static code to layout files when you are done, I am planning on automating this
  <li><strong>BACKUP</strong> YOUR CODE BEFORE USE, this exporter deletes files to update them, so make sure you have <strong>BACKUP</strong> of your code before you use it.</li>
</ul>

Have fun.
Controbutions would be highly appreciated I made this for the community.
